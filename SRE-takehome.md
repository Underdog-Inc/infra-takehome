# SRE Take Home Exercise

## Problem
A tech startup is launching a fantasy sports application and wants to make the
application go live publicly with an estimated average throughput of 1000 requests/second.
The technology stack  includes a JavaScript frontend web application, a monolithic
Ruby-on-Rails backend application to handle business logic, and a PostgreSQL database.

## Deliverables

Please consider the following criteria, and formulate a plan to launch the new
application and handle user traffic appropriately.

  * Propose cloud of your choice for IaaS and PaaS usage
  * Which managed services would you want to propose to host and manage this
    application on the cloud?
  * Describe how you would make the backend deployments scalable and reliable
  * What additional components would you add to improve response time, latency,
    and overall performance?
  * What tools would you use to define the infrastructure and deliver the two
    applications to their respective cloud services?
  * Describe how you can enable developers to self serve on deployment and debugging
  * Explain what processes you would set up internally to alert and remediate issues
  * Use draw.io or any other tool of your choice and send us an architecture
    diagram of the infrastructure and deployed application, along with the above
    mentioned proposal
